# Flashcard Quiz App

The Flashcard Quiz App is a web application built using Redux and Redux Toolkit to manage the state of a flashcard-style quiz system. With this app, users can create topics, quizzes for those topics, and flashcards for those quizzes. Users can interact with the quizzes by flipping the flashcards over to see the answers.
